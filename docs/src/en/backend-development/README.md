# Backend development

Many frameworks officially support Kotlin: [Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0), [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/guides/kotlin), [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor), among others [listed here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html#deploying-kotlin-server-side-applications).

In addition to that, Kotlin is theoretically compatible with any framework that targets the JVM or JS.
However, this generally requires more effort to achieve.
For example, this tutorial shows [how to use nodejs with kotlin](https://medium.com/@touskar/une-application-nodejs-avec-kotlin-1969994fb1d2)

## PW: develop an API with Ktor
